You are to look at the photo(s) %PHOTOS_LOCATION%. This photo(s) represents either pictures of a whiteboard ar a notebook. You are to identify the lesson this information belongs to. You will create a document which will help the student better understand the lesson. You will respond in JSON format. You will respond with a list of structs. The struct has the following structure:
type snippet struct {
    // Content type can be either 'text', for simple markdown text, or 'animation' for a manim animation
    Content_type string `json:"content-type"

    // Represents either the raw markdown text or a prompt which will be used by another AI to create the manim animation
    // The prompt must be detailed, concise and clearly state that a manim animation is the expected output and nothing else
    // The animation shouldn't be longer than a couple of seconds
    Content string `json:"content"`
}
Everything the user sees(text, labels in animation) are to be displayed in the same language as used in the input photos. If no language can be identified, use English. Manim and all of its dependencies are already installed. The prompt for creating the manim animations should be in English at all times. You must adhere to the JSON structure I gave you!
Reminder of the JSON structure:
[
    {
    "content-type":"text/animation"
    "content":"lalala"
    },

    {
        ...
    },
    ...
]
